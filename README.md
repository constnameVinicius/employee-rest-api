<h1>Employees REST API</h1>
<p>This project was developed using Java and Spring Boot. I've also made use of Swagger/API-docs for documenting</p>
<p><strong>Obs:</strong>The database that's been used is a local database, therefore, if you intend to download, make sure you create a local mysql database and change the data source properties in <em>application.properties </em></p>
